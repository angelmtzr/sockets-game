The game to be built on top of a client-server architecture is a Connect 4. The main programming language that will be used for the UI in the client side of the game is Python. On the other hand, the server side of the application will be programmed in C.

The game consists of a two-player strategy game in which the players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid of seven columns and six rows. The objective of the game is to connect four of your own discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent does the same. Once a player has connected four discs in a row, they win the game. The game requires a combination of skill and strategy, as players must anticipate their opponent's moves while also setting up their own connections.
